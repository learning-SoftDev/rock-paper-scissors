# rock-paper-scissors

This is a simple rock paper scissors game. It was created during my learning curve in TOP (The Odin Project). <br>

Things I learned:<br>

- Deep understanding of the power of divs and display:flex<br>
- Sss specificity and other rules (prioritization)<br>
- Javascript -> it was hard for me to grasp the concept at first since I came from a simple language (python), but as I read through the documentations in the internet, I understood the logic behind the syntax<br>
- Difference between var, let, and const for declartion of variables<br>
- DOM selectors getElementByID and querySelectorAll<br>
- The most important thing I learned here is the event listeners and how they work, the requirements, etc.<br>
