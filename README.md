# rock-paper-scissors

This is a simple rock paper scissors game. It was created during my learning curve in TOP (The Odin Project). 

Things I learned:
-Deep understanding of the power of divs and display:flex
-css specificity and other rules (prioritization)
-javascript -> it was hard for me to grasp the concept at first, but as I read through the documentations in the internet, 
I understood the logic behind the syntax
-difference between var, let, and const for declartion of variables
-DOM selectors getElementByID and querySelectorAll
-The most important thing I learned here is the event listeners and how they work, the requirements, etc.
